To Grief - My Beloved  

We walked down rickety avenue today with our boy R, He's quite the charmer. two girls his age were staring at him, either he looked very obnoxious or devilishly pretty, either way, he got attention. The dog followed us down rickety avenue, the blossoming trees with red flowers were a gorgeous sight. their twisting branches mangling our view of the sky. quite the rare occasion I thought, the sky being blocked. for such a giant to be overpowered by such rickety wood with such a twisted snare was quite the shame.  

My girl came back from her school trip today, she says it was exciting, I wanted her to tell me more but all she did was go to her room and shut the door. kids her age do that a lot apparently. My friend and I would be talking about it and all that I could be thinking about is how she used to be such a sweet little daughter of mine that used to play in my lap, and on my hair, and head, and hang off of my elbows, and kiss my cheeks, and say that she loved me; and Now all she does is suck on her idiotic little pen and hang out with her friends at the mall.

The boy came back in the evening with a scratched knee, crying, Oh the god awful crying, that word is an understatement; Screeching more like, I sometimes wonder if he really is a human child.  

It has been an exhausting day, I'll kiss my wife goodnight and go to sleep.
