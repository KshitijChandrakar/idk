To Grief. *My Beloved!*  
I had the appointment with the doctor today. He has Black eyes. Phyrric hair, Brown skin. I asked him about what his hair was like before. He said Not mine. I asked him is it his now. He agrees, he says that he stole it. I ask him who did it belong to before. He told me to bring my dog.  

It was quite a nice excuse having a dog. I wouldn't have minded seeing him again. while he doesn't seem to be the conversation type he also seems to be the type who has storms inside them. Afraid it'll leak out they hide in silences until they know someone enough to know that their hearts were made for stormy seas. Bored of calm waters then they reveal themselves, slowly at first, Hesitantly, afraid, terrified even that that someone would find it repulsive; after that comes the tsunami, the stories, the years of boredom that they had hoarded in their hearts only to reveal and revel in it until a few months when *that* someone decides to get *bored*, and moves on with their life. grief is weird like that, it carries on in your heart, taking the place of the thing you grieve, it is weird in the sense that it is the thing that you're grieving. Only non-existent.  

I had to leave his office, my appointment was over. The dog was vaccinated, the kids can keep it. they haven't given it a name yet. maybe I should give it the name of the doctor.  

I reached my home, lunch was ready. I talked to my wife about her day, and I talked to my kids about their days. The  boy was very excited to tell me about a rock that a girl gave him (*wow*, he really is popular with the girls isn't he), and my girl told me about a new band she found, the singer puts on quite terrifying eyeliner, but I support her, she should explore it is probably a phase anyway.

in the evening we go for a walk again.
At night I'll kiss my wife goodnight, and go to sleep.
