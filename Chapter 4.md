To Grief (?) My Beloved  

I woke up today with a headache, it was quite annoying to have considering the fact that it was 10 am, I was late. the kids needed lunch and their mom had gone out with her friends for the day. I told her I'd take care of them and look at me now, struggling to even wake up on time. Why did she not make them breakfast? God knows. Why did that little girl not wake me up? Who knows, I asked her and she says she didn't want to. teenagers.

I made the kids breakfast of bread and jam, and then dropped them off at their school. They'll stay there a while I suppose. Finally had some peace and quiet before the dog decided it needed to go on a walk. Did I care much for it? no. Would I have much rather stayed in bed and rested for a bit? Oh very much gladly yes. So we went on the walk. It's little legs still rickety from god knows what. I decided to go to the veterinarian considering we might actually keep this annoying little thing.

The doc vaccinated the dog and told me to bring him back in a week. He was very handsome, annoyingly so. I went back home and slept away the afternoon.
I woke up, reminded that I had in fact forgotten to clean the dishes and it was past school hours for the kids. There were three missed calls on my phone from the school and four from unknown numbers. Worried I rushed to the school and picked up the kids, it was beginning to drizzle. the boy, unsurprisingly so was crying and the girl was unchanged as always. I asked them if they wanted to go for ice cream. they said yes. we got ice cream.

we came back home. I cleaned, cooked dinner. and waited for their mom to come back. She did, we had dinner.
It was a good day, The doctor was very nice.
I kiss my beloved wife goodnight, and go to sleep.
