To Grief - My Beloved  

My wife fainted today, I took her to the hospital, and she was fine. I swear her eyes rolled back in her skull before she did. My worry ate me up while the doctor inspected her. He was in there for a while, I paced around the whole hospital ward and my worry was a total companion. What a great way to show loyalty. She came out after 34 minutes and 5 seconds. The doctor said she was fine. we went home.  

The kid's scratched knee got better. Only I know how much that boy screamed over the little cut. it didn't even hurt that much and all he did was cry about it. We went on a walk under the trees again, the sky once again stood defeated.  

My daughter still is the same, she comes out of the room once or maybe twice to eat and then goes back into her little slumbering mess of a room. I want to kiss her forehead and tell her that she's not alone and that she can talk to me. My wife says that she'll come around eventually.  

It was a fine day, Everything went fine. I'll kiss my wife goodnight and go to sleep.
