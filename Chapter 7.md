What a mess  
I am bored  
My wife is doing the dishes, I did the lunch.  
Really curious about what happened to the doctor, yes yes ii know that it has just been a single day since i saw him but i would reaaly like to talk to him again, he seemed quite cheery.

other than that, i asked if i could sit down next to my daughter for once, she agreed. she showed me her room, I asked her about the eyeliner man. She told me something about a black parade. we listened to it together. I feel like she is quite nice as a person, I'm not sure who she is anymore but i would love to get to know her. i just wish she doesnt end up being a stranger again.

My son is doing nicely, he talks about girls which is quite frankly interesting. Margaret the mean one stole his lunch, i might have to do something about that but other than that I'll talk to her teacher.  

Other than that today was good, my curiousity is alive but other than that I'll kiss my wife goodnight and ill sleep.
