To Grief - My Beloved,
Today my wife sits on the kitchen platform, Her eyes blue, her smile pink and her jawline smooth. Its quite the weird caricature, her bossom goes up and down slowly, her lips parted, her legs closed off under her sundress.  

it's summer, the dog is playing outside and the kids are at the school. My *sherbet* lays gently in my hands as her body enjoys the summer warmth. I was never quite the summer person, it never agreed with me. the humidity, the heat, the sweat and yet it always looked good on her. it looked good on her skin, it looked good on her hands, her palms, her hair, her roses.  

They were quite the miracle the roses, their white essence filled our garden, and yet we had decided to keep a few red ones in the mix, to keep things interesting. they added complexity to our garden, texture, flavour, smell. Life is good, I thought. My kids are well, so is my wife. I have a good job. it pays well, we are well off. the dog seems quite content even in this heat. All waggy tails and wholesome yapping tongue. I had never been a dog person before. I'm still not but my boy, R decided one day that the little pup with the rickety legs would be a great addition to the family. I protested, so did my wife. We kept the dog.
